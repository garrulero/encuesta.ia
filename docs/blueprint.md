## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333333) to mimic the monochromatic retro style, providing a subdued background for content.
- Background color: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for a clean and high-contrast interface reminiscent of Windows 95.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for buttons and interactive elements, providing a subtle visual distinction.
- Body and headline font: 'Perfect DOS' for a pixelated, monospaced look that evokes the retro Windows 95 aesthetic.
- Use simple, pixelated icons in the style of ASCII art to represent actions and concepts within the application.
- Design the interface with a minimalist approach, using modal windows and rectangular buttons with a pressed effect on click to emulate the Windows 95 UI.
- Implement subtle slide animations for transitions between questions and use a blinking cursor style for text inputs.
